# Honorable mentions
A, _hopefully_, long list with a lot of useful scripts that you should take a

## sysinstall
Just type
```
sysinstall <package>
```
on any distro, with pacman like syntax!. Still on development...

## ytfzf
Don't open that browser windows when you can even see thumbnails and more with
