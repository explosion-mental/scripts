# scripts
Useful scripts (made by hand or forked from) and some of Luke's scripts.

There are 5 directories:
- **Divine** - experiments, ideas, fun..
- **cron** - for cronjobs (non interactive)
- **dmenu** - scripts that _can_ use dmenu or _hardcoded_ to dmenu
- **statusbar** - no flags, self descriptive and they print a new line at the
  end so it's compatible with most bars (e.g. polybar)
- **zshcomp** - zsh completitions for some scripts


Generally, scripts will be self explanatory
