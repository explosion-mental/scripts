# scripts
Useful scripts (made by hand or forked from) and some of Luke's scripts.
Generally, scripts will be self explanatory.

There are 5 directories:

# Divine
Experiments, ideas, fun..

# cron
Scripts for cronjobs, non interactive.

# dmenu
Scripts that have an **option** or are **hardcoded** to use dmenu.

# statusbar
Self descriptive scripts that print useful information and a new line at the
end, so it's compatible with most bars (e.g. polybar).

These handle the `$BLOCK_BUTTON` enviromental variable since they were thought
about to use dwmblocks.

# zshcomp
zsh completitions for some scripts
