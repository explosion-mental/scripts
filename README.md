# scripts
Some usefull scripts or forks of (and of course Luke's scripts).
The important ones are:

## termyt
The changes I made where on adding a way to see thumbnails, which now I barely use, by typing "i " before your search. The original idea was to give thumbnail to the video your going to watch but it gets annoying.

## dmenurl
I got this from Luke's scripts but I can't find it anymore, I made some changes and this is some kind of handler (Yes I use vlc, my mpv is broken).

## redyt
Bugswriter script, really cool!
Few changes
- Best options on sxiv (imo)
- Reddit colorsü§ìüëç

## dmenu_browser
I forgot where I got this, but I use it to search firefox (since my url bar is hidden) and surf.
Even bookmarks, youtube, wikipedia, etc... (you implement what you want)

## clipmenu
Forked to work with **xclip**
Apparently there are more scripts than clipmenu and clipmenud(daemon). You decide what you want (I recommend to put clipmenu, clipmenud and clipdel on one of your directories appended to the PATH variable), also is initended to be install with the makefile so i change it a bit to make it better. Pretty clean code I really like thatüëç

## qndl
script with a little handler to handle all kinds of urls. Youtube is problematic since I can't tell if I'm going to download a video or audio (song), so the second argument of the script, right now only with this arguments, takes 'audio'.

_qndl "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQ4KJF-6Agc" 'audio'_

## mpdonti
Notification when used, I need help on improving time ( 0.6-0.9 secs ).

Have fun!
