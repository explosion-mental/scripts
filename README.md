# scripts
Some usefull scripts or forks of (and of course Luke's scripts).
The important ones are:

## termyt
The changes I made where on adding a way to see thumbnails, which now I barely use, by typing "i " before your search. The original idea was to give thumbnail to the video your going to watch but it gets annoying.

## dmenurl
I got this from Luke's scripts but I can't find it anymore, I made some changes and this is some kind of handler (Yes I use vlc, my mpv is broken).

## redyt
Bugswriter script, really cool!
Few changes
- Best options on sxiv (imo)

## dmenu_browser
I forgot where I got this, but I use it to search firefox (since my url bar is hidden) and surf.

## clipmenu
Replace the two of this scripts on the github repo you cloned. Pretty clean code I really like thatüëç

## mpdonti
Notification when used, I need help on improving time ( 0.6-0.9 secs ).

Have fun!
