echo "I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as
Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus
Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free
component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs,
shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by
POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without
realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is
widely used today is often called \“Linux\”, and many of its users are not
aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There
really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the
system they use.

Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s
resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part
of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the
context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination
with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux
added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called \“Linux\” distributions are really
distributions of GNU/Linux." | xclip -sel c ;;
